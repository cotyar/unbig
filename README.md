# un-BigData
## Claim: For 100s of millions of data points/sec no BigData solution is needed. 
They say: "BigData is a data processing which doesn't fit into one machine" (c).

These days a single commodity box can get you quite far performance-wise.
Millions of rows processing per sec is easily achievable even for complex calculations. 

## Tested on Black-Scholes what-if-s.  
The ultimate goal is to reach 1 billion scenarios/sec tested on a single machine.
